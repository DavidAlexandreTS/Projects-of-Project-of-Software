* Functionalities

  The Software has several features, some of them are: Account creation, profile creation and editing, sending messages and requests for friendship, and creating communities.

* Classes

  The Software has in all 7 classes. As it was a relatively simple program I could have reduced these classes to only 5, however, for reasons of organization and better visualization of methods, I chose to maintain the 7 classes.
  The advantages of creating classes include better code organization, better visualization opportunity, and as a whole assures me well that each "entity" will work in a way expected by me. I believe that at this point there are no disadvantages, the classes were very well thought out and elaborate, however, I could turn one or two into methods.

* Distribution of Methods

  The methods of these Software are relatively simple, they are composed of getters and setters and in general, i have tried to make them as generic as possible. From this, I distribute them very well among the classes that would actually use them. The advantages i can cite here are evident: much more simplicity in the program as a whole and in general more organization in the classes. I think a major drawback would be the amount of actions i had to figure out how to handle some things, maybe building more methods would help me solve some of that problem (for example, methods for searching in ArrayLists).
