* Functionalities

  The Software has several features, some of them are: Account creation, profile creation and editing, sending messages and requests for friendship, and creating communities.

* Classes

  The Software has in all 7 classes. As it was a relatively simple program I could have reduced these classes to only 5, however, for reasons of organization and better visualization of methods, I chose to maintain the 7 classes.
  The advantages of creating classes include better code organization, better visualization opportunity, and as a whole assures me well that each "entity" will work in a way expected by me. I believe that at this point there are no disadvantages, the classes were very well thought out and elaborate, however, I could turn one or two into methods.

* Distribution of Methods

  The methods of these Software are relatively simple, they are composed of getters and setters and in general, i have tried to make them as generic as possible. From this, I distribute them very well among the classes that would actually use them. The advantages i can cite here are evident: much more simplicity in the program as a whole and in general more organization in the classes. I think a major drawback would be the amount of actions i had to figure out how to handle some things, maybe building more methods would help me solve some of that problem (for example, methods for searching in ArrayLists).
  
  * Inheritance 

  Maybe this was the most difficult part of the project. All this for a simple reason: I did not know where to use it. However, i found a legal alternative to using inheritance. Such a solution was motivated by the following thinking: The need for an account to create a profile. This undoubtedly made me see that the Account could be a Super Class and Profile could be its heir (sub-class).
  In this case using inheritance did not bring me many advantages, on the other hand, i was not harmed in any way. So i used inheritance as a way to keep the original idea alive.
  
  * Abstract
  
    I did not use any kind of abstract class. Just because I do not feel the need for it.
    
   * Interface
   
    Initially several interesting questions arose in my mind regarding the use of interface in this project. But then I thought hard and saw that it was not necessary. I thought about using it to authenticate a community administrator, but the advantages turned out to be minor and so I decided to simplify it more. Anyway, I chose not to use an interface, because I think it is unnecessary in relation to this Software.
